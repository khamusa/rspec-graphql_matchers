## 1.3.0 (May 7th, 2020)

-   `have_a_field` matcher accepts `.with_deprecation_reason` (https://github.com/khamusa/rspec-graphql_matchers/pull/34 thanks to @TonyArra).

## 1.0.1 (June 22th, 2019)

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed issue causing `have_a_field(x).of_type(Y)` to fail on fields defined on implemented interfaces that were defined with legacy syntax.

## 1.0 (June, 2019)

### Breaking changes

-   Support to property and hash_key matchers will be dropped on upcoming releases.

### Deprecations

-   `.with_metadata` and `.with_property` matchers for fields will be removed on the next release;
-   `.accept_arguments` (plural form) will be removed on the next release;
-   `.accept_argument` (singular form) receiving a hash with a single or multiple arguments will no longer be supported, use `accept_argument(name).of_type('MyType')` instead.

### New features

-   Add support for Class-based type definition api (adds support for graphql-ruby v1.8.x). Please note that `.with_metadata` and `.with_property` support has been kept but will only work on fields defined using the legacy api.
-   Implemented `accept_argument(arg_name).of_type('MyType')Â´ matcher, which returns much clearer error messages when the arguments are not found on the target type.
